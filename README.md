In four European countries (Italy, Greece, Croatia and France), the project partners set up Social Hackademy Labs and, through an extensive 100-hour combined training course, educate a total of 120 disadvantaged young people aged 16 to 29. three areas:
- development of native mobile applications,
- web design and
- visual and graphic design.

I was designing an app for an organization called Feniks, which wanted an app for mental health.
UI and UX design was made using Figma,

Mobile app was made in Dart with Flutter framework.


The app has sign in/register screen, home screen where user can see their moods for the day and main function of the app which is mood tracking. App is connected via Google Firebase.
